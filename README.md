# A comparison of human vs chatGPT clustering on Greek proverbs

## Description:
This notebook contains a human-based clustering and analysis of the clustering done by master's students on a series of Greek proverbs. Additionally, a similar analysis is performed on clusterings generated by GPT models on the same proverbs, following instructions given to the model. Finally, a comparison between Humans and GPT is performed to identify interesting results and patterns.

### 1. Human-Based Clustering:
- Analysis of clusters generated by master's students.
- Evaluation of similarities and differences among clusters.
- Identification of patterns and insights derived from human clustering.

### 2. GPT-Based Clustering:
- Utilization of GPT models to perform clustering on Greek proverbs.
- Analysis of clusters generated by GPT models.
- Examination of the effectiveness and accuracy of GPT-based clustering.

### 3. Comparison: Humans vs GPT:
- Comparative analysis between human-generated clusters and GPT-generated clusters.
- Identification of similarities, differences, and interesting patterns between the two sets of clusters.
- Insights into the capabilities and limitations of human clustering compared to GPT-based clustering.

## Conclusion:
The notebook concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the clustering results obtained from both human and GPT-based approaches. It provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method and highlights potential avenues for further research or improvement.
